In Source_Classifiers.txt we classify the sources of our biochemistry in three tiers:

1) Primary Database: This is only KEGG and MetaCyc, the two sources of the structural data we used to perform our initial merger
2) Secondary Database: This is any other database that was integrated based on aliases, including names
3) Published Model: This is data from any published metabolic reconstruction

In the "Source" column for the biochemistry, we use these three classifiers in succeeding order, and a fourth classifier for any
new compounds or reactions that do not come from these three sources: "User".
