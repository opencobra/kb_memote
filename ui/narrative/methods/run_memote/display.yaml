     <p>Genome-scale metabolic models are tough to understand at a glance.
     Memote, short for metabolic model tests, is here to change that.
     For a given metabolic model, the tests in memote fulfill two purposes:
     They give you 1. an independent, comparable score and 2. a comprehensive overview.
     The tests were selected on the basis of previously established guidelines and are
     continuously curated by the community. For further information visit

     <p>Implemented in KBase by: Janaka/Christian/Filipe</p>
